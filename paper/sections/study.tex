\section{Measurement Study}
We conduct a study where we characterize the location of the bottleneck link as measured by popular speed test tools. We focus on two such tools, namely Ookla Speed test and M-Lab Network Diagnostic Test (NDT). In addition, we focus on the question whether the bottleneck link is within the last-mile ISP or upstream. We use the Netrics platform for these measurements. 

\textbf{Data Collection}: 
Describe Netrics deployment, including number of tests, time period of the study, number of vantage points.

\subsection{Results}

The data reveals interesting differences between the two tools. The last-mile ISP is the bottleneck for xx\% tests in Ookla, while this number is yy\% in MLab. Further dissecting them by the speed tests, the difference between the two tools increases.
